I make a sample as on my template
I already uploaded my template into your github

Now I will config some "link" to make it work.

2 Folder

1.DEBs: You have to put all Deb file in this folder
2.Depictions:All information of deb will write in here. Example: screen shot, changelog, infor.....
I will make example of 1 deb later.

......................

Let I make example of your new HACK norecoil

Please make sure do exactly the name of deb
You can make code HTML for screen shot.... whatever...

After you have done the infor and cope deb file to folder.

Then you make pakage and upload it to your repo.

About check sum: You can do or not . Just use software and find it. I use winMD5. 

Remember: depiction link: copy exactly the Publish Link
Name of Folder deb ( must exactly name, Folder( hskmodmenu) in depiction)

Afterthat, save the package

Now You have to upload Packages to github

Everytime, you add one new deb please repeate all work have done.
then go to "package "file. 
- Copy sample and paste 
- Edit the name, info, link....
- Then save it

Delete the old Packages.bz2 
"Fletch it " in Github desktop. It will delete the old package in Github reposity

Now you have to make new Packages 
Use 7zip software
Add to achive and zip to BZIP2

then go to github desktop . Push it in Repo

DONE.
